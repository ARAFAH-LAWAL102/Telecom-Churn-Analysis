# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
# Project Background
The telecom company has been operating for several years, offering voice, data, and roaming services across various regions. With a growing customer base and rising competition, the company faces increasing customer churn. This project aims to identify factors contributing to churn, using SQL-based data cleaning and EDA, and translate these insights into a Power BI dashboard for strategic decision-making.

# Insights and Recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

1) Churn Rate and Customer Behavior

2) Contract Renewal & Tenure Segmentation

3) Data Plan, Charges & Usage Metrics

4) Service Call Patterns & Roaming Fees

The SQL queries used to inspect and clean the data can be found here: SQL Data Cleaning

# Data Structure 

The cleaned dataset includes 3,333 customer records with the following columns:

Churn: 1 if customer left, 0 if retained

AccountWeeks: Tenure in weeks

ContractRenewal: 1 = renewed, 0 = not renewed

DataPlan: 1 = yes, 0 = no

DataUsage: Monthly data in GB

CustServCalls: Number of service calls

DayMins, DayCalls: Avg daytime minutes/calls

MonthlyCharge: Monthly bill

OverageFee: Last 12-month peak overage

RoamMins: Avg monthly roaming minutes

Initial SQL steps included transforming binary columns to readable labels, binning tenure into ranges, and checking missing/null values.

# Executive Summary

The analysis reveals a churn rate of 14.5%, with the majority of churners having no data plan, multiple service calls, and higher monthly charges and overage fees. Churn was more likely among users who did not renew their contracts and those with 200+ active weeks. Roaming usage was also slightly higher among churners. These insights empower the business to reduce churn by targeting these key segments.
